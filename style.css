/*The parent class contains the yellow, green, and blue boxes, and they will be drawn inside the frame for the parent
class. Resizing the width of the class to 33% changes the width of the parent frame, but *not* the individual boxes
within it. This results in a stack of three boxes that take up  a third of the width of the screen and cannot be
forced to share a line. Changing float properties affects whether or  not the *parent* frame hides behind the red box,
but does not allow the child boxes to sit next to one another, because they are still taking up 100% of the width of
the container, which happens to be smaller than the width of the screen. If the parent class is defined as 33% of the
screen width and you then set the individual box values to some percentage (33%), then you end up with three boxes that
take up 1/9 of the screen width, because they inherit scale values from the parent class as well as their own
individual definitions. */
